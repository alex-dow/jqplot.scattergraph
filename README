- SCATTER GRAPH PLUGIN FOR JQPLOT
--

There was no scatter graph support in jqPlot, but I needed a scatter graph. So I made one.

This is released under the MIT License and is in no way complete. It will be nice to see this
get matured eventually.

Yes, it would have been nice, but there is no point. Far better tools exist for your scatter graph needs. This project is dead and the repo will be deleted eventually.

Here is an example of how I used it:

$.jqplot('results-graph',points, {
	sortData: false,
	title: 'Crosstable Cooccurrence',
	seriesDefaults: {
		renderer: $.jqplot.ScatterLineRenderer,
		markerRenderer: $.jqplot.ScatterMarkerRenderer,
		markerOptions: {
			style: 'scatter',
			allowZero: true,
			printSize: false
		},
	},
	series: sizes,
	axesDefaults: {
		tickRenderer: $.jqplot.CanvasAxisTickRenderer,
		tickOptions: {
			showGridline: false,
			angle: -30,
			fontSize: '10pt'
		}
	},
	axes: {
		xaxis: {
			ticks: xAxisLabels,
			renderer: $.jqplot.CategoryAxisRenderer,
			tickOptions: {
				angle: -60
			},
			autoscale: true
		},
		yaxis: {
			ticks: yAxisLabels,
			renderer: $.jqplot.CategoryAxisRenderer,
			autoscale: true,
			tickOptions: {
				angle: -10
			}
		}
	}
});

You need to provide two sets of information: the list of points, and the list of sizes for each point.

The points are a multidimensional array representing a table:

PHP:
$array['row1'] = array(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
$array['row2'] = array(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

JavaScript:

var points = new Array();
points.push(new Array(1,2,3,4,5,6,7))
points.push(new Array(1,2,3,4,5,6,7))

the sizes array contains a list of sizes for each point, using the markerOptions config object:

JavaScript:

var sizes = new Array();
sizes.push({markerOptions: {size: 1}});
sizes.push({markerOptions: {size: 100}});

This is of course not the BEST way of setting up your graph, but it works. Hopefully these plugins will improve over time.
